/**
 * <p>Hash table and linked list implementation of the {@code Map} interface,
 * with predictable iteration order.  This implementation differs from
 * {@code HashMap} in that it maintains a doubly-linked list running through
 * all of its entries.  This linked list defines the iteration ordering,
 * which is normally the order in which keys were inserted into the map
 * (<i>insertion-order</i>).  Note that insertion order is not affected
 * if a key is <i>re-inserted</i> into the map.  (A key {@code k} is
 * reinserted into a map {@code m} if {@code m.put(k, v)} is invoked when
 * {@code m.containsKey(k)} would return {@code true} immediately prior to
 * the invocation.)
 *
 * <p>This implementation spares its clients from the unspecified, generally
 * chaotic ordering provided by {@link HashMap} (and {@link Hashtable}),
 * without incurring the increased cost associated with {@link TreeMap}.  It
 * can be used to produce a copy of a map that has the same order as the
 * original, regardless of the original map's implementation:
 * <pre>
 *     void foo(Map m) {
 *         Map copy = new LinkedHashMap(m);
 *         ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * This technique is particularly useful if a module takes a map on input,
 * copies it, and later returns results whose order is determined by that of
 * the copy.  (Clients generally appreciate having things returned in the same
 * order they were presented.)
 *
 * <p>A special {@link #LinkedHashIntIntMap(int,float,boolean) constructor} is
 * provided to create a linked hash map whose order of iteration is the order
 * in which its entries were last accessed, from least-recently accessed to
 * most-recently (<i>access-order</i>).  This kind of map is well-suited to
 * building LRU caches.  Invoking the {@code put}, {@code putIfAbsent},
 * {@code get}, {@code getOrDefault}, {@code compute}, {@code computeIfAbsent},
 * {@code computeIfPresent}, or {@code merge} methods results
 * in an access to the corresponding entry (assuming it exists after the
 * invocation completes). The {@code replace} methods only result in an access
 * of the entry if the value is replaced.  The {@code putAll} method generates one
 * entry access for each mapping in the specified map, in the order that
 * key-value mappings are provided by the specified map's entry set iterator.
 * <i>No other methods generate entry accesses.</i>  In particular, operations
 * on collection-views do <i>not</i> affect the order of iteration of the
 * backing map.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #removeEldestEntry(IntIntMap.Entry)} method may be overridden to
 * impose a policy for removing stale mappings automatically when new mappings
 * are added to the map.
 *
 * <p>This class provides all of the optional {@code Map} operations, and
 * permits null elements.  Like {@code HashMap}, it provides constant-time
 * performance for the basic operations ({@code add}, {@code contains} and
 * {@code remove}), assuming the hash function disperses elements
 * properly among the buckets.  Performance is likely to be just slightly
 * below that of {@code HashMap}, due to the added expense of maintaining the
 * linked list, with one exception: Iteration over the collection-views
 * of a {@code LinkedHashMap} requires time proportional to the <i>size</i>
 * of the map, regardless of its capacity.  Iteration over a {@code HashMap}
 * is likely to be more expensive, requiring time proportional to its
 * <i>capacity</i>.
 *
 * <p>A linked hash map has two parameters that affect its performance:
 * <i>initial capacity</i> and <i>load factor</i>.  They are defined precisely
 * as for {@code HashMap}.  Note, however, that the penalty for choosing an
 * excessively high value for initial capacity is less severe for this class
 * than for {@code HashMap}, as iteration times for this class are unaffected
 * by capacity.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 * If multiple threads access a linked hash map concurrently, and at least
 * one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it <em>must</em> be
 * synchronized externally.  This is typically accomplished by
 * synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map.
 *
 * If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 * unsynchronized access to the map:<pre>
 *   Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new LinkedHashMap(...));</pre>
 *
 * A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more
 * mappings or, in the case of access-ordered linked hash maps, affects
 * iteration order.  In insertion-ordered linked hash maps, merely changing
 * the value associated with a key that is already contained in the map is not
 * a structural modification.  <strong>In access-ordered linked hash maps,
 * merely querying the map with {@code get} is a structural modification.
 * </strong>)
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by the {@code iterator} method of the collections
 * returned by all of this class's collection view methods are
 * <em>fail-fast</em>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after
 * the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * {@code remove} method, the iterator will throw a {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw {@code ConcurrentModificationException} on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness:   <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
 *
 * <p>The spliterators returned by the spliterator method of the collections
 * returned by all of this class's collection view methods are
 * <em><a href="Spliterator.html#binding">late-binding</a></em>,
 * <em>fail-fast</em>, and additionally report {@link Spliterator#ORDERED}.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
 *
 * The spliterators returned by the spliterator method of the collections
 * returned by all of this class's collection view methods are created from
 * the iterators of the corresponding collections.

     * Implementation note.  A previous version of this class was
     * internally structured a little differently. Because superclass
     * HashMap now uses trees for some of its nodes, class
     * LinkedHashMap.Entry is now treated as intermediary node class
     * that can also be converted to tree form. The name of this
     * class, LinkedHashMap.Entry, is confusing in several ways in its
     * current context, but cannot be changed.  Otherwise, even though
     * it is not exported outside this package, some existing source
     * code is known to have relied on a symbol resolution corner case
     * rule in calls to removeEldestEntry that suppressed compilation
     * errors due to ambiguous usages. So, we keep the name to
     * preserve unmodified compilability.
     *
     * The changes in node classes also require using two fields
     * (head, tail) rather than a pointer to a header node to maintain
     * the doubly-linked before/after list. This class also
     * previously used a different style of callback methods upon
     * access, insertion, and removal.
